# Convex-Optimisation-Assessment
This repository contains the programming assignments and my solutions given in the MTH377 course (Convex Optimisation - COO) in Winter'23.

### Assessment 1
- Implementation of various descent-based algorithms and other mathematical paradigms for unconstrained optimisation.

### Assessment 2
- Solved inequality and equality-constrained problems using Python's `CVXPY` library.
- Also implementing the Interior Point Algorithm for solving inequality-constrained convex optimisation problems.

Feel free to raise an issue in case of any doubts or queries.
